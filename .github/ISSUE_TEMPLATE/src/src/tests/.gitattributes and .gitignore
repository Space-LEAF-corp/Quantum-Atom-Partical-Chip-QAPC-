How to lock it down

• Create the repo and push these files.
• Generate hashes: after first commit, compute SHA-256 of canonical files and fill QR-DNA-MANIFEST.yaml.
• Create a signed tag:• git tag -s v1.0.0 -m “QR-DNA Seal v1”
• git push origin v1.0.0

• Enable branch protection on main:• Require signed commits
• Block changes to canonical files unless steward overrides
• Require passing “verify” workflow

• Publish README emphasizing “read-only by default” and consent process.
• Optionally add Sigstore cosign to sign releases.
